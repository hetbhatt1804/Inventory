# Bookstore CLI Project 

## üìö About This Project
Hey! This is a **small Python CLI project** I made to manage a bookstore's inventory and sales. I used:
- pandas for working with csv files
- numpy for calculations
- matplotlib and seaborn for graphs

## ‚ú® What It Can Do
- Add books with price and quantity
- Update book stock
- Record sales when books are sold
- Show reports with:
  - Bar chart of total books sold
  - Line chart of monthly sales
  - Pie chart of revenue by genre
  - Heatmap of price vs sales
- Shows average, max, min of price and sales using numpy

## üìÇ Files in This Project
- `inventory.csv`: keeps track of books
- `sales.csv`: keeps track of sales
- `bookstore.py`: main code file

## üõ†Ô∏è How To Run
1. Install the required libraries if not installed:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

2. Run the python file:
```bash
python bookstore.py
```

3. Use the menu to:
- Add books
- Update stock
- Record a sale
- View reports

## üöÄ Why I Made This
I made this to practice pandas, numpy and data visualization for my learning. It also helped me understand how to work with csv files and simple CLI menus in Python.

Feel free to use this project for your practice and edit it to add more features.
